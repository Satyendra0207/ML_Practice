# Project
# Title - Mall Customer Segmentation 
In this project I have used the K- means clustering which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
This Project contains ipnyb file 

 1- * K_means_Mall_customers.ipynb * on Mall customer data set
 
      Motive- Grouping the customers of mall according to their Age, Annual Income and Spending Scores for better Marketting Strategy

# Source of Dataset - Kaggle
 1-Help taken from - Prabhat Banerjee Notebook on kaggle

 2-Help taken from -Suchita Sharma Notebook on Kaggle

# Platform
 Used google Collab for this task

# Python Libraries
 1-NumPy -For Dealing with matrix and arrays 

 2-Pandas-for dealing with dataframe

 3-Matplotlib-for visualization

 4-Seaborn-for visualization

 5-Scikit-Learn -for model building, Training and Testing

# Steps Involved
 1- Imported the required libraries

 2-Mounted the drive for accessing the file that contains dataset of the Fecebook live 

 3-Understanding the Data 

 4-Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

 5-Feature Scaling

 6-Model Building - K-means Clustering

 7-Optimal no of CLusters

 8-Visualization of clusters 

 9-Conclusion
 
# Result
  On the basis of cluster formed  we can form our marketting strategy that will attracts the max number of customers.
